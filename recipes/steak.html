    <h2>Rib Eye Steak</h2>
    <p>Tender and delicious Ribeye Steak cooked to a juicy perfection! Seasoned with fresh herbs, then cooked in a cast-iron skillet and basted with 
        garlic butter, everyone will love this easy steak recipe!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye: You’ll need a pound or so of bone-in ribeye steak, 1-inch to 1-1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt & Ground Pepper: To taste</li>
        <li>Rosemary: You’ll need to strip the leaves off of a stem or two of fresh rosemary and give it a chop; about 2 teaspoons.</li>
        <li>Fresh Thyme: Again, strip the leaves from the stem and chop them, this time about 1 teaspoon.</li>
        <li>Butter & Oil: You’ll need a couple of tablespoons of unsalted butter and one tablespoon of olive oil, for sauteing.</li>
        <li>Garlic: No need to mince the garlic here, just smash three cloves and peel away the papery outer skin.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring Steak to Room Temperature: Take the steak out of the fridge and pat it dry with paper towels. Salt it liberally on both sides. Let it sit on the counter at room temperature for 30 minutes. Don’t skip this part.</li>
        <li>Season The Steak: Sprinkle the steak with pepper, rosemary, and thyme; using your fingers, press the herbs down into the meat.</li>
        <li>Cook First Side: In a cast iron skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the butter and swirl it around. Place the steak in the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook Second Side: Turn the steak over; add the smashed garlic to the skillet, and continue to cook 5 more minutes. Tilt the skillet and spoon the butter drippings over the steak, occasionally.</li>
        <li>Check Doneness & Rest Steak: Check the internal temperature of the steak before removing it from the heat. For a rare steak, the internal temperature should read 120˚F; for medium-rare, it should be around 125˚F to 130˚F. Remove from the heat, and transfer to a cutting board; let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
