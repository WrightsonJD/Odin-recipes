    <h2>Crispy Buffalo Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>Crispy baked buffalo chicken wings are the perfect crowd-pleasing wing recipe for game day or any day of the week! These wings are perfectly crispy, without any traditional frying, Whole30 compliant, Paleo friendly, and naturally gluten free. Just a few simple ingredients is all you need to whip up a batch!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Wings: This recipe uses “party” wings which are also sometimes referred to as “split” chicken wings. The wing is separated into two parts. These kinds of wings are what most people think of when they hear buffalo wings.</li>
        <li>Avocado, Coconut Oil, or Ghee: All you need is one tablespoon of cooking fat and either of these will work. Just be sure to avoid olive oil. It has a lower smoke point and is not the best choice for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Spices: This recipe keeps it simple and uses only salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. Spices you probably already have on hand.</li>
        <li>Baking Powder: Ive made these wings both with and without baking powder and both versions turn out great. But, if you want a little extra crispiness, I recommend adding a little baking powder does the trick!</li>
        <li>Buffalo Sauce: You can make your own buffalo sauce or buy your favorite to drizzle over all your crispy wings!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels and then add them to a large mixing bowl. Add the avocado oil, baking powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt to the wings and toss until well coated. </li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken wings on a baking sheet in a single layer but not touching. Bake the wings for 40-45 minutes until golden brown and the skin is crispy, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>While the wings are baking, heat the buffalo sauce in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <li>Once the wings are done cooking, transfer them to a large mixing bowl and pour the warm buffalo sauce over the wing. Toss until well coated. </li>
        <li>Transfer the wings to a serving platter, garnish with thinly sliced green onion and serve with ranch, celery, and carrots.</li>
